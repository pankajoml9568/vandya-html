                <p class="wow animate__fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.5s">Partnering with Parents: Every caregiver is a part of the child’s learning process. It is our strong belief that education is best achieved when it involves a three-way communication between the child, educator, and parent. To that end, the school maintains an open channel of communication with the parents through regular counselling and interactive sessions, welcoming the parents to visit the school and talk to the teachers every fourth Saturday of the month.</p>
                
                <p class="wow animate__fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.5s">Open Houses and regular interaction allow parents to engage in frank discussions with the Principal, Vice Principal, and teachers about their ward's progress. It is after such an endeavour that all the stakeholders share the same zest for learning and enthuse confidence in the process. Bridging Gaps, Parent Volunteer Workshops, Webinars and Grand Parents' Day, provide forums to listen to parents and other family members and to guide them on how to handle the new age generation, with so much exposure. Parents can also contribute by volunteering for the Shadowing and Internship Program and help students explore career options. Such involvement helps us to understand parents' perspectives and gives us a chance to put forward our expectations and the kind of support we need in order that together we can bring up a wholesome new generation.</p>
