                <p class="w-95 wow animate__fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.5s">At the very centre of school life, stands a powerful commitment to outstanding pastoral care and guidance for all our young people. One of the greatest strengths of the school is its strong pastoral component and that, clubbed with a strong sense of community here - one that of friendship, of shared endeavour - ensures that our pupils flourish as personalities in school and beyond that. The school team enables all young people to feel safe, be happy and confident, and to make good progress in their learning, irrespective of their backgrounds and differences. We recognize that each young person has a unique set of needs and talents, and our Pastoral System works to ensure that we help all individuals identify and fulfil their goals.</p>

                <h5>Wellness Centre</h5>
                <p>The school supports a well-equipped six-bedded infirmary. A full-time MBBS doctor assisted by trained staff is present during regular school hours. Regular medical check-ups and immunization are carried out for all students and staff members. All health records, immunization records and emergency contacts are kept up to date and are easily accessible in case of an emergency. Pertinent health histories (such as allergies, chronic conditions or susceptibilities) are also required. Parents are required to periodically update their child’s medical records. Medical Records are maintained for each student and an Annual Medical Examination is conducted by the school for each student and member of the staff. Parents are sent a report for follow up action.</p>

                <p>Any case of emergency receives immediate medical attention as the school has a tie-up with a neighbourhood hospital in case of need. The facility is well equipped to provide any primary care to an emergent COVID suspect.</p>

Regular workshops and training sessions are held for teachers and students regarding Cyber Safety and norms of safe use of technology.</p>

                <p>All staff members and senior students are trained in basic minimum first aid. CCTV cameras and fire extinguishers, as well as air purifiers, are installed throughout the school building and the school grounds.

                <p>School buses ply all around the city. All school transport has a well-maintained GPS tracking system and parents can keep a check on their child’s safe school-ward and homeward journey. All buses have two attendants (one male & one female) on duty. To reduce the carbon footprint the school encourages students from close-by areas to car-pool with a single parent in case they are not using the school transport.</p>

                <h5>Dining</h5>
                <p>The School Central Dining Hall (CDH) is a well-ventilated facility with spaced-out seating capacity. This is done to ensure that no Covid norms are flouted. Nutritious, wholesome, and scrumptious meals satiate the hunger and satisfy the taste buds thrice a day. The students are served Breakfast, Lunch, and Evening Snacks. Dining halls serve hygienic and nutritious vegetarian meals under the supervision of a trained dietician. Requests for a special diet, supported by medical evidence, are accommodated in cases of illness, convalescence, and allergies to specific food items.</p>

                <p>The well-trained staff and dedicated chefs introduce students to local and international cuisines that also inculcate an appreciation of varied cultures and preferences. Dining as a community also helps the students to enjoy mealtimes and the entire Vandya community engages in a happy dialogue. Students are not permitted to bring any outside food unless otherwise mentioned informal communication with the parents. There is a no-tolerance policy for any junk food and carbonated beverages at school.</p>
