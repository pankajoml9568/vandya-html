                <p class="w-95 wow animate__fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.5s">Education is meant to build. Build, not just as an end, but also as a means to that end. This idea clearly challenges the age-old thought of a child coming in as a “clean-slate”. Every learner at every stage comes in with a set of experiences and stories. Vandya has a pedagogy that does not outrightly negate their prior experiences. Much rather, we appropriately build upon, challenge, and nurture what they come in with. This makes sure that the child is as much a participant in the learning process rather than just being a recipient. Such a learning process that is based on construction constantly evolves and asks the the following questions to stay relevant and child-centric: <strong>What should we continue doing?</strong> <strong>What should we abandon?</strong> <strong>What needs to be creatively invented afresh?</strong></p>

                <p>The Teaching-Learning Environment thus developed factors in the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Recognizing learners as the core participants, encouraging their active engagement, and developing in them an understanding of their own activity as learners (“self-regulation”)</li>
                    
                    <li>Being founded on the social nature of learning and actively encouraging group work and well-organised cooperative learning</li>
                    
                    <li>Employing learning professionals who are highly attuned to learners’ motivations and the key role played by emotions in achievement</li>
                    
                    <li>Being acutely sensitive to individual differences among the learners, including the type and extent of their prior knowledge</li>

                    <li>Devising programs that demand hard work and that challenge everyone without excessive overloading them</li>

                    <li>Operating with clarity of expectations and using assessment strategies consistent with these expectations, with a strong emphasis on formative feedback to support learning</li>

                    <li>Strongly promoting “horizontal connectedness” across areas of knowledge and subjects as well as with the community and the wider world.</li>

                <h5>Training & Development</h5>
                <p>The term “Pedagogy” at Vandya is not limited to just students or “Teaching to Teach”. It in fact extends to Learning to Teach and Learning to Learn. Each lesson taken by the teacher is in itself an opportunity to learn and grow not just for the student but also for the teacher. From such everyday teaching-learning opportunities to carefully curated programs that help teachers to evolve and constantly see purpose in the efforts they make are a part of the Vandya Training and Development Program.</p>
