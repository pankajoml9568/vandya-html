                                            <p class="f-14">Dear Friends<br>Vandya International School is a safe, supportive but most especially a beautiful place in which to work and grow. I am delighted and honored to have the opportunity of leading this excellent School, full of warmth, opportunity and ambition for the day children who come from the land of blue hills and red river. We are highly progressive with our roots embedded in our illustrious culture. Aligned with the National Education Policy, Vandya International School believes in providing wings and roots to its students and tirelessly works on this philosophy. </p>

                                            <p class="f-14">As I look out from my office over green mountains laden with overcast sky, I am constantly reminded of the importance of this unique environment to children’s learning and development. The purpose is to create the right climate, so that the child may develop fully as a complete human being. This means giving him/her the opportunity to blossom in goodness so that he/she is rightly related to people, things and ideas, to the whole of life. </p>

                                            <p class="f-14">We at Vandya aim to provide a high-quality, comprehensive, and meaningful education for all students. Each student will be expected to succeed within the bounds of their abilities and chosen educational goals. Each student will be treated as an individual, given the tools to be a lifelong learner, and taught to function as a member of a group and make a lasting impact as a productive member of society. Our endeavour is to empower all students to apply their acquired skills and knowledge, and be confident of their personal attributes to lead productive lives and to become ethical citizens of the global community. Such competence building can only happen when teaching-learning is a simultaneous process. Our teachers are called Masters because they are highly skilled but not limited to their subjects. I am sure all of us reminisce about our teachers not just for the subjects they taught, but also for the life lessons they blessed us with.</p>

                                            <p class="f-14">Our intention is to educate the whole human being and cultivate in them a passion for inquiry; pursuit of truth; a willingness to stand by (and for) their own choices; a strong ethical core; ability to choose between the right and the wrong; and a deep interest in getting to ‘the bottom of things’.</p>

                                            <p class="f-14">VIS will strive to develop mutually rewarding relationships with its pupils, who consider it as their second home, feel it and respond to it; they help run the school, take responsibility for it, care for it, not only during their stay but for years to come. At VIS, its learners would have developed lifelong friendships that chronological time will just not be able to affect. They would feel responsible for the future of their institution and make sure that their Alma Mater of true education survives and flourishes.</p>

                                            <p class="f-14">I invite you to explore our website, which is a virtual glimpse into the Vandya experience. Of course, nothing can replace visiting the campus in person, so I strongly encourage you to book a tour with our Admissions Office. We welcome you to explore our beautiful campus, meet a community of friends and mentors, and discover where one belongs.</p>
